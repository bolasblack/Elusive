# Elusive

Fork from [Helium](https://github.com/JadenGeller/Helium), but not a floating browser window for watch media.

It support display browser window by url scheme:

    elusive://?x=10&y=20&width=200&height=180&url=https://google.com

* `x`, `y` the window coordinate
* `width`, `height` the window size
* `url` the url Elusive will load
